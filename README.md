# Interactive Form Project

In this project I was tasked with providing a solid user experience in form navigation and validation. 

To do this I provide a user experince with the following criteria:
-   Hide conditional form fields until specific conditions were met
-   Realtime form validation
-   Disabling the Submit button until all validations are true
-   When an activity is selected - disable activities with conflicting times
-   Calculate the total cost
